# Digit Recognizer
Digit Recognizer is a web-based application which can recognise handwritten digits and classify them. This application is created for the purpose of learning to build a Machine Learning model and deploying it as an app. So, Handwritten Digit Recognition model is based of a Deep Learning architecture and built on TensorFlow framework can recognise digits and classify them into classes. The web application is built primarily on Node.js framework.
